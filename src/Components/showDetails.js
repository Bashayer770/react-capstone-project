            If there is one iconic building that is synonymous with Florence it
            is The Duomo. Located in the historic city center of Florence, the
            Piazza del Duomo is certainly at the top of places to visit in
            Florence. Standing front and center in the Piazza is the Duomo of
            the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (Cathedral of Saint Mary). It
            is one of Italy’s most recognizable sights with the immense dome
            towering overhead. The Piazza del Duomo is a meeting place, a
            shopping center, and a spot to grab a bite to eat or a glass of wine
            as you take in the surrounding views of Ciott’s Campanile, the
            Duomo, and the Baptistery. Go first thing in the morning to avoid
            the crowds.

            There are so many museums in Florence it can be difficult to choose
            which one to see. Well, when in doubt, choose one of the largest.
            Palazzo Pitti is one of Florence’s biggest Museums where you can
            walk through the former residence of the Medici. It is a large
            complex located on the Arno River with several galleries to explore
            including the Gallery of Modern Art, The Costume Gallery, and
            Italian art. Inside you’ll see works of art by Italian icons such as
            Raphael, Caravaggio, Titian, Pietro da Cortona, and Rubens.

            Piazza Della Repubblica is one of the main squares in Florence,
            marking the center of the city. The Square has stood since Roman
            Times and was once the Jewish Ghetto, but it has undergone many
            changes throughout the years. It is the perfect place to grab an
            espresso at either Caffé Gilli, Caffé Paskowski or Caffé delle
            Giubbe Rosse. Here you can people-watch or take in a street
            performance. There is a carousel and the column of the Abundance.

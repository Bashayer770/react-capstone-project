      the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (Cathedral of Saint Mary).
      It is one of Italy’s most recognizable sights with the immense
      dome towering overhead. The Piazza del Duomo is a meeting place, a
      shopping center, and a spot to grab a bite to eat or a glass of
      wine as you take in the surrounding views of Ciott’s Campanile,
      the Duomo, and the Baptistery. Go first thing in the morning to
